## 💵 Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

```
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $9.99/month
Average Customer Lifespan: 18 months (estimated)
Gross Margin: 85% (typical SaaS)

LTV = $9.99 × 18 × 0.85 = $152.83

With annual plan (30% choose):
LTV = $125 (annual) × 1.5 years × 0.85 = $159.38

Weighted Average LTV: ~$155
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Organic Channels (Target):**
```
SEO: $0-5 per customer
Product Hunt: $0-2 per customer
Reddit/Twitter: $0-3 per customer
Word of mouth: $0 per customer

Target CAC: $5-10
```

**Paid Channels (Future):**
```
Google Ads: $20-50 per customer
Twitter Ads: $15-30 per customer
Content Partnerships: $10-20 per customer

Acceptable CAC: <$50 (3:1 LTV:CAC ratio)
```

### Key Metrics

```
LTV:CAC Ratio: 15:1 (organic) or 3:1 (paid)
✅ Target: >3:1 (healthy)

Payback Period: <6 months
✅ Target: <12 months (healthy)

Gross Margin: 85%

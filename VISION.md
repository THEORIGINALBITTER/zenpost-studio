# ZenPost Studio Vision

## Long-Term Direction

ZenPost Studio aims to become:

- The local-first alternative to AI SaaS writing tools
- A structured documentation engine for developers
- A publishing infrastructure layer for technical teams

## Strategic Goals

1. Provider-agnostic AI layer
2. Structured transformation pipelines
3. Documentation that survives 5+ years
4. Enterprise-ready deployment
5. Plugin-based extensibility

ZenPost is infrastructure, not influence software.

## First Comment (Maker's Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Denis, and I'm excited to launch **ZenPost Studio** - a free, open-source AI tool that transforms your content for any platform.

**The Problem I Solved:**

As a developer who creates content, I was spending 2-3 hours adapting every article for different platforms:
- LinkedIn needs professional tone + hooks + hashtags
- dev.to needs technical depth + code examples
- Twitter needs thread format (280 chars)
- Medium needs storytelling format
- Reddit needs community tone + TL;DR

Manually doing this is exhausting and time-consuming.

**The Solution:**

ZenPost Studio uses AI to transform your content automatically:
1. Write once in markdown
2. Select target platform
3. Click "Transform"
4. Get perfectly optimized content in 10 seconds

**What Makes It Special:**

🔒 **Privacy First**
- No backend servers
- API keys stored locally only
- Your content never leaves your browser
- 100% transparent (open source)

💰 **Free Core + Optional Cloud**
- MIT licensed open source (free forever)
- Self-host: $0/month
- Cloud hosting: $9-29/month (optional, for convenience)
- Enterprise support: Custom pricing
- Or use local Ollama (completely free AI)

🤖 **Flexible AI**
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet)
- Ollama (local AI - free!)
- Custom API endpoints

🎨 **Beautiful Design**
- Hand-drawn Zen aesthetics (rough.js)
- Dark theme, monospace typography
- Not another Bootstrap clone

**Key Features:**

✨ **Content Transformation**
Transform for: LinkedIn, dev.to, Twitter/X, Medium, Reddit, GitHub Discussions, YouTube scripts

📝 **Code Documentation**
Paste code → Get professional README with installation, usage, API docs

✏️ **Markdown Editor**
Real-time preview, syntax highlighting, auto-growing textarea

**Tech Stack:**

React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
No backend required - everything runs in your browser

**Real Use Case:**

I used ZenPost Studio to create this very Product Hunt launch:
- Started with base content in markdown
- Transformed for LinkedIn → professional post
- Transformed for Twitter → engaging thread
- Transformed for dev.to → technical article
- Transformed for Reddit → community discussion

Saved me 2+ hours. Content is perfectly optimized for each platform.

**Cost Comparison:**

**ZenPost Studio (Self-Hosted):**

- Tool: $0 forever (open source)
- AI: ~$0.01-0.05 per transformation (or $0 with Ollama)

**ZenPost Studio (Cloud Hosting):**

- Tool: $9-29/month (includes hosting + support)
- AI: Included in price

**Commercial Alternatives:**

- Tool A: $29-99/month
- Tool B: $49-199/month
- Tool C: $15-75/month

**Yearly savings with self-hosting: $348-1,188**

**What's Next:**

🖥️ Desktop app (Tauri) - Windows/macOS/Linux
📱 Mobile version - iOS/Android
🎨 Custom templates - Save transformation styles
🔌 Plugin system - Community extensions

## FAQ (Prepare Answers)

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes! The core tool is MIT licensed open source - free forever. Self-host it for $0/month. We also offer optional cloud hosting ($9-29/month) for non-technical users who want convenience. No freemium trap - the self-hosted version has ALL features.

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT?**

A: OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini), Anthropic (Claude 3.5), Ollama (llama3.1, mistral, codellama), and custom API endpoints.

A: Yes! Use Ollama - download models locally (~5GB), run offline, 100% free. No API keys needed.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Absolutely. No backend servers. API keys stored in browser LocalStorage only. Content never sent to our servers (we don't have any). Open source - verify yourself.

**Q: Can I self-host?**
A: Yes! It's client-side only. Just `npm run build` and deploy the `dist/` folder anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, your own server).

**Q: What platforms do you support?**
A: Currently: LinkedIn, dev.to, Twitter/X, Medium, Reddit, GitHub Discussions, YouTube scripts. More coming based on feedback!

**Q: Can I customize transformations?**
A: Prompts are currently hardcoded but configurable in source. Planning template system where you can save custom transformation styles.

**Q: Will the free version lose features later?**
A: Never. The self-hosted open source version has ALL features and will remain free forever. We're building a sustainable business with optional cloud hosting and enterprise support - but the core stays free. This is our commitment.

**Q: How good is the AI quality?**
A: Depends on provider. Claude 3.5 produces excellent quality. GPT-4o-mini is fast and good. Ollama is surprisingly capable for being free.

🚀 **Launching ZenPost Studio – Free AI-Powered Content Transformation Tool**

After months of development, I'm excited to share ZenPost Studio with the developer community.

**The Problem:**

Every content creator faces this: You write one great article, but sharing it across LinkedIn, dev.to, Twitter, Medium, and Reddit means rewriting it 5+ times. Each platform has different formats, tones, and best practices.

What if AI could adapt your content for any platform in seconds?

**The Solution: ZenPost Studio**

✨ Transform markdown content for any platform with AI
🔄 Convert code to professional documentation instantly
📝 Real-time markdown editor with live preview
🔒 100% privacy-first (runs in your browser, no backend)
💰 Free & open source forever

**What makes it different:**

• **Your AI, Your Choice** – Use OpenAI, Claude, or FREE local Ollama
• **Privacy First** – Your API keys never leave your browser
• **Beautiful Design** – Hand-drawn Zen aesthetics, not another Bootstrap clone
• **Developer Focused** – Built by a developer, for developers
• **No Subscriptions** – Pay only your AI provider (or $0 with Ollama)

**Real Use Case:**

Instead of spending 2 hours manually adapting content for 5 platforms, you now:
1. Write once in markdown
2. Click platform (LinkedIn, dev.to, Twitter, etc.)
3. Get perfectly optimized content in 10 seconds

**Tech Stack:**

React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + Rough.js
Supports: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Ollama, Custom APIs

**Open Source & Free:**

⭐ Star on GitHub: github.com/theoriginalbitter/zenpost-studio
📚 Full Documentation: theoriginalbitter.github.io/zenpost-studio
🚀 Try it now: Clone, install, start transforming

**Who is this for?**

✓ Developers sharing technical content
✓ Technical writers managing docs across platforms
✓ Content creators maximizing reach
✓ Developer advocates building community

**Coming Soon:**

🖥️ Desktop app (Tauri) – Windows/macOS/Linux
📱 Mobile version
🎨 Custom transformation templates
🔌 Plugin system for community extensions

**Why Open Source?**

I believe in transparency, privacy, and community. Commercial alternatives cost $29-99/month and lock you in. With ZenPost Studio, you own your workflow.

**Try it yourself:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theoriginalbitter/zenpost-studio.git
npm install && npm run dev
```

Configure your AI provider (2 minutes), and start transforming content.

**What do you think?**

Is content repurposing a pain point for you too? How do you currently handle multi-platform content?

Drop a comment – I'd love to hear your workflow! 👇

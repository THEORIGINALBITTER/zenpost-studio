## The Problem

Every developer who creates content knows this pain:

You write one great tutorial. But sharing it means:
- **LinkedIn:** Add professional hooks, bullet points, hashtags
- **dev.to:** Technical formatting, code blocks, front matter
- **Twitter:** Break into 280-character threads
- **Medium:** Storytelling format, longer paragraphs
- **Reddit:** Community-friendly tone, TL;DR

That's **2-3 hours** of manual work. For *every single article*.

## The Solution: ZenPost Studio

I built an AI-powered tool that transforms your content for any platform in seconds.

🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/theoriginalbitter/zenpost-studio
📚 **Docs:** https://theoriginalbitter.github.io/zenpost-studio/

### What It Does

1. **Content Transformation** - Write once in markdown, transform for LinkedIn, dev.to, Twitter, Medium, Reddit, GitHub Discussions, or YouTube
2. **Code Documentation** - Paste code, get professional README with installation, usage, API docs
3. **Markdown Editor** - Real-time editor with live preview, syntax highlighting
4. **Multi-AI Support** - Use OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, local Ollama, or custom API

### Why It's Different

**🔒 Privacy First**
- No backend servers
- API keys stored locally (LocalStorage only)
- Your content never leaves your browser
- Open source - see exactly what it does

**💰 Free Forever**
- MIT licensed open source
- No subscriptions ($0/month)
- Pay only AI provider costs
- Or use Ollama locally (100% free)

**🎨 Beautiful Design**
- Hand-drawn Zen aesthetics (powered by rough.js)
- Dark theme, monospace typography
- Not another Bootstrap clone

**🤖 Flexible AI**
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Ollama (llama3.1, mistral, codellama - runs locally)
- Custom API endpoints

## How It Works

### Step 1: Write Your Content

Use the built-in markdown editor:
- Live preview toggle
- GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Auto-growing textarea

### Step 2: Choose Platform

Select where you want to publish:
- **LinkedIn** → Professional tone, hooks, hashtags
- **dev.to** → Technical depth, code examples, front matter
- **Twitter** → Thread format, engaging hooks, 280-char chunks
- **Medium** → Storytelling, longer paragraphs
- **Reddit** → Conversational, TL;DR, community-focused
- **GitHub Discussions** → Technical Q&A format
- **YouTube** → Video script with timestamps

### Step 3: Transform with AI

Click "Transform" and get platform-optimized content in seconds.

## Real Example

Traditional approaches have 3 problems:
1️⃣ Props drilling
2️⃣ Redux boilerplate
3️⃣ Unnecessary re-renders

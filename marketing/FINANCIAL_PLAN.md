## 7. Funding Requirements

### Bootstrap Strategy (Recommended)

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Self-Funded**
- Investment needed: €16,823
- Source: Personal savings or side income
- Risk: Low (already built, just need hosting)

**Phase 2 (Months 4-12): Revenue-Funded**
- Use MRR to cover operating costs
- Reinvest profits into marketing
- No external funding needed

**Phase 3 (Year 2+): Profitable**
- Self-sustaining
- Option to take outside investment for rapid scale
- But not necessary

### Alternative: Angel/Pre-Seed Round (Optional)

If you want to scale faster:
- **Raise:** €50,000 - €100,000
- **Equity:** 10-15%
- **Use of funds:**
  - €20,000 - Marketing & user acquisition
  - €15,000 - Desktop/mobile app development
  - €10,000 - Enterprise features
  - €5,000 - Legal & accounting

**Not recommended unless:**
- You want to quit your job and work full-time
- You want to hire a team quickly
- You want to dominate the market faster

## 8. Risk Analysis

### High Probability Risks

**1. Slow User Adoption**
- **Risk:** Fewer than 50 Cloud signups in Year 1
- **Mitigation:** Increase marketing, improve onboarding, add killer features
- **Impact:** Delays break-even by 6-12 months

**2. High Support Burden**
- **Risk:** Support takes >20 hours/week
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive docs, FAQ, community forum, automated responses
- **Impact:** Need to hire support sooner (€500-1000/month)

**3. AI Provider Price Changes**
- **Risk:** OpenAI/Claude increase API prices
- **Mitigation:** We pass costs to users, promote Ollama (free), add more providers
- **Impact:** Minimal (costs passed through)

### Medium Probability Risks

**4. Competitor Launches Similar Tool**
- **Risk:** Large company (e.g., Notion, Grammarly) adds similar feature
- **Mitigation:** Open source = community moat, privacy focus, desktop app advantage
- **Impact:** Could slow growth, but we have first-mover advantage

**5. Enterprise Sales Take Longer**
- **Risk:** Enterprise deals take 6-12 months instead of 1-3
- **Mitigation:** Focus on self-serve Pro tier, keep enterprise as bonus
- **Impact:** Delays Year 2 revenue by 20-30%

### Low Probability Risks

**6. Legal Issues (AI/Copyright)**
- **Risk:** Legal challenges around AI-generated content
- **Mitigation:** User owns content, we're just a tool, strong ToS
- **Impact:** Could require legal budget (€5,000-10,000)

**7. Technical Debt**
- **Risk:** Rapid growth exposes architectural issues
- **Mitigation:** Refactor early, hire experienced developers
- **Impact:** Need to allocate development time (€3,000-5,000)
